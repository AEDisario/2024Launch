        DISARIO, founded by Alessandro Disario, started out by making classic products made from the highest quality fabrics and to the most exacting standards for friends and family. Focusing on staples like belts, wallets, and shirts, and developing close working relationships with Italian manufacturers, DISARIO’s design philosophy of the interaction between colour, material and silhouette was formed.
        </p>

       <p>DISARIO’s first collection, now available to the public for the first time, is motivated first and foremost by the principles of classic Italian tailoring re-interpreted for the world today, and prioritising the objectives of making a functional, stylish garment for the modern man: something that is never out of fashion and always wearable.
