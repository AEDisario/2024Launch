        <p>Our inaugural collection features a carefully curated selection of fabrics, predominantly sourced from Italy, and generally used for classical tailoring. We also integrate select fabrics from Japan and the UK, enriching the collection’s diversity. Each piece in the collection has been made entirely in Italy, offering exceptional craftsmanship and durability, designed to last.</p>

                <p class="capital-nonbold">Technical Cotton</p>
                <p>Woven in Como, Italy, by a company that has decades of experience making high quality technical fabrics. The cotton polyester blend used for our jackets are an example of their expertise, it has a fluidity and softness rarely felt in technical fabrics. And of course it has all the advantages of technical fabrics, in that it is water repellent, and resistent to wear and tear.</p>

                <p class="capital-nonbold">Mako' Cotton Jersey</p>
                <p>After sampling multiple great cotton fabrics for our T-shirt, our decision fell on this Egyptian cotton. Produced in
                upper Egypt to be precise, Mako’ cotton features a thread length of 30-34mm, which are used for finest cotton fabrics.
                The spinning, weaving and dyeing has subsequently been done in the North of Italy. Making it in a sense an Italian
                Egyptian cotton fabric.</p>

                <p>
                    
                The fabric used in our straight-fitting trousers shares a similar trajectory with our Mako Cotton Jersey, but this time, the yarns are sourced from Tasmania. Tasmania is renowned for producing top-quality wool owing to its favorable climate and careful sheep breeding. The subsequent spinning, weaving, and dyeing processes take place in Italy. The outcome is a soft, durable, and mostly beautiful fabric, often employed for bespoke suiting.

                <p class="capital-nonbold">JAPANESE COTTON TWILL</p>
                <p>The Japanese cotton we used for one of our pants and one of our jackets is a reproduction of a military fabric. The yarn
                used is a double twisted mercerized thread which gives a certain brightness to this fabric. Not only gives it brightness
                to the fabric, it also makes it highly durable, as military fabrics were intended.</p>

                <p class="capital-nonbold">Extrafine Merino Wool</p>
                <p> Where else then Biella could we have ended up sourcing the Extrafine Merino Wool yarns for our knitwear? Filatura Tollegno, founded in 1900, is famous for combining its high level yarns with their commitment to sustainability. For our heavier 7 gauge sweater, we have used their finest and extremely soft 2/30nm micron merino fiber, which has been doubly twisted. This offers a dense yet very soft and durable sweater.

                <p class="capital-nonbold">2-ply Cotton Poplin</p>
                <p>The cotton used for our shirts is a Thomas Mason two-ply poplin cotton. Thomas Mason fabrics have, because of their
                exceptional quality, for centuries been used by the British aristocracy for their bespoke shirts. With our shirts, we
                want to offer the quality of a bespoke shirt with a softer, more relaxed construction.</p>

                <p class="capital-nonbold">British 8-wale corduroy</p>
                <p>For the corduroy fabric, which we chose for one of the zipped jackets and pleated pants, we naturally turned our attention to England. Our supplier is more than 150 years in business and at the forefront of the production of, amongst others, corduroy fabrics. We choose this corduroy fabric not only for its durability, but also because a good corduroy offers such a rich colour. </p>
